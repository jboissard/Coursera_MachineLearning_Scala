# Coursera_MachineLearning_Scala
Small Machine Learning Library in Scala + exercises of the Coursera Machine Learning Course solved in Scala

The purpose of this repository is twofold:

1. Give a very simple Machine Learning Library in Scala and Breeze
2. Practical examples of how the Library can be used. For this, some exercises of the Coursera Stanford Machine Learning taught were solved (the inputs can be used without any alteration)
